Network Bandwidth Logging CLI

### Inspiration
BSNL Broaband Service who provoked me to write this script 🤬

### Setup 
You will need a Google Sheet and it's `Sheet ID`, `Client ID` and `Private Key` which you will get from Gooogle Console > Credential Section.
I will mention the steps in Wiki.
Apart from that, you need a terminal to execute this but I did it in RaspberryPi (Optional, I just did it to flex 😂).

### Project Structure
`app.js` will be your main file and then there is a `controller` file and some `helper` files for all the external packages which I have used.
There is no hard-and-fast rule, you can do whatver changes you want. Just keep it sane and tidy ❤️
